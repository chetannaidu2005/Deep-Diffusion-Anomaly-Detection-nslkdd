# Deep Diffusion Anomaly Detection on NSL-KDD Dataset

This repository presents a custom-built anomaly detection pipeline using deep diffusion models applied to the NSL-KDD dataset — a widely used benchmark for network intrusion detection. The solution is implemented entirely from scratch without relying on third-party diffusion libraries.

---

##  Project Highlights
- Built a custom deep diffusion model from scratch for detecting anomalies in network traffic data.
- Developed a complete preprocessing pipeline including encoding, scaling, and binary labeling.
- Optimized denoising diffusion probabilistic modeling (DDPM) for discrete, high-dimensional cybersecurity data representations.
- Applied advanced anomaly detection techniques to the NSL-KDD dataset, simulating real-world network security scenarios.
- Conducted multi-metric evaluation including ROC-AUC, precision-recall tradeoff, and interpretability-driven visualization of anomaly scores.
