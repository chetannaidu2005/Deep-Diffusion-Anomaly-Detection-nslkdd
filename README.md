# Deep-Diffusion-Anomaly-Detection-nslkdd
An in-depth implementation of a diffusion-based anomaly detection model applied to the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset. This project explores the generative modeling capabilities of diffusion processes for identifying cyber threats in high-dimensional network traffic data, emphasizing robustness, interpretability, and reproducibility.
